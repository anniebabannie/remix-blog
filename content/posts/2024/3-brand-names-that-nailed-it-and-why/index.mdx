One of my favorite subjects to nerd out on is _branding_. Without good branding, you aren't able to reach the people your product would serve best. Much like design, branding combines the poetry of art with the practical needs of a business, and when done well, becomes a highly compelling force.

Choosing a name for your brand is extremely important in the successful marketing of a product, and today I want to examine a handful of companies that **just fucking nailed it, and why.**

<h2>Tigris</h2>

_Tigris is a globally distributed S3-compatible object storage service that provides low latency anywhere in the world, enabling developers to store and access any amount of data for a wide range of use cases._

Drawing inspiration from the iconic Tigris River, a vital component of the historic Tigris-Euphrates River system that cradled the Fertile Crescent, the birthplace of ancient Mesopotamian civilization, the name Tigris embodies the essence of reliability, connectivity, and progress. Just as the ancient Tigris River served as a lifeline for the birth of civilization, trade, and communication in Mesopotamia, Tigris, the S3 alternative, serves as a digital conduit, enabling the global flow of information essential for modern-day web applications.

That, my friends, is a _damn_ compelling name for a globally distributed object-storage solution.

<h2>Verizon</h2>

_Verizon is an American wireless network operator and popular cell phone service provider._

I wish I could say that I figured out the genius in the name Verizon, but I did not. This one is subtle, but quite possibly my favorite name. Let's start with the obvious bit: Verizon sounds like the word _horizon,_ which echoes the promise of a broad network. But then there's the _Ver-_ part; what's that about?

Well, turns out _ver-_ is the Latin root for _truth._ Now before you start rolling your eyes at bringing etymology into my argument, because who the heck knows enough about etymology to connect the dots about Verizon's name, let me point out that English speakers will still understand this on a subconscious level due to our exposure to certain words, such as _verify_ (to confirm the truth), _verdict_ (the establishing of a truth)_, verily_ (in truth). Thus, **the name Verizon implies "reliability as far as the eye can see."**

<h2>Ulysses</h2>

_The Ultimate Writing App for Mac, iPad and iPhone: Powerful features and a pleasant, focused writing experience combined in one tool, made for people who love to write and write a lot — this is Ulysses._

TELL ME this isn't the most seductive name for an app targeted toward writers, particularly aspiring novelists. Let's talk about why.

Derived from the Latin rendition of the Greek hero Odysseus, the app Ulysses pays homage to the protagonist of Homer's timeless epic, The Odyssey. By invoking this name, the creators of Ulysses tap into the deep-seated desire within every writer to craft narratives as enduring and captivating as those found in literary masterpieces like The Odyssey.

These three are just some of my favorites. **Leave a comment on the Twitter thread** for this post to share brands that you think absolutely _crushed_ the naming of their product or service.
